# üöÄ Tasks Breakdown
# üß© Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species
Goal: Train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict iris flower species.
# Key Steps:

* Preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, label encoding).
* Trained a DecisionTreeClassifier.
* Evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.
* Visualized results via a confusion matrix.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

# üí¨ Task 3: NLP with spaCy

Dataset: Sample Amazon Product Reviews
Goal: Extract named entities (brands/products) and perform sentiment analysis.
# Key Features:

* Used spaCy‚Äôs Named Entity Recognition (NER) for brand detection.
* Applied a rule-based sentiment analyzer for positive/negative classification.
* Displayed results with extracted entities and sentiment labels.

üß∞ Tech: spaCy, Python

# ‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

- Bias in Models:

* MNIST: Style and cultural bias due to uniform handwriting samples.
* Amazon Reviews: Linguistic bias in sentiment detection.

- Mitigation:

* TensorFlow Fairness Indicators to visualize fairness across subgroups.
* spaCy rule-based tuning to handle context and reduce bias.

- Debugging Challenge: Fixed TensorFlow errors like input dimension mismatches and incorrect loss functions.

# üß© Summary of Tools Used
Category	Tools/Libraries	Purpose
Machine Learning	Scikit-learn, Pandas	Classical ML & Decision Trees

# üßæ Ethics Report (Summary)

Ethical considerations are vital to ensure fairness and transparency in AI systems. 
The MNIST CNN model may perform unevenly on diverse handwriting styles, while the spaCy-based sentiment 
analyzer might misinterpret sarcasm or dialects. Tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators help detect subgroup performance gaps, 
and spaCy‚Äôs rule-based refinement supports contextual fairness. Together, these techniques foster responsible and inclusive AI development.
